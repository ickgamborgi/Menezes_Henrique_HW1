## Project
You will research the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev) and create a character/movie guide. Look through the documentation to learn how to access the information as JSON. You must populate an unordered list with 10 or more characters.

Each list Item should contain the name of a character that acts as a link to one of the movies the character was in. When the character link is clicked a separate AJAX call/function will be called and will return a movie title, the opening crawl and movie poster to a separate section on the page (you will have to source the poster images and store them in your images folder).

The guide must be responsive from mobile to desktop. Additional GreenSock enhancements and features are strongly encouraged. You must also also make use of the HTML Template element or template literals as covered in class. Your Fetch functions should handle the stages of an AJAX request gracefully - what happens if the request fails (use separate functions / handlers for each stage of an AJAX request). You should also implement a loading icon to indicate the content is loading.
